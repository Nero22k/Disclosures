# CVE-2024-48292: Privilege Escalation in QuickHeal Antivirus Pro and Quick Heal Total Security

## Description
An issue in the `wssrvc.exe` service of QuickHeal Antivirus Pro v24.0 and Quick Heal Total Security v24.0 allows authenticated attackers to escalate privileges.

## Vulnerability Type
Elevation of Privileges

## Vendor
QuickHeal

## Affected Products
- QuickHeal Antivirus Pro - Version 24.0
- Quick Heal Total Security - Version 24.0

## Affected Component
`wssrvc.exe` service that runs as `NT AUTHORITY\System`. This service constantly attempts to connect to a non-existing named pipe (`\\.\Pipe\pipe_quickup`) without validating the pipe, making it susceptible to impersonation.

## Attack Type
Local

## Impact
Privilege escalation, enabling the attacker to operate as `NT AUTHORITY\System`.

## Attack Vector
An attacker with a local user account and `SeImpersonatePrivilege` can open a server pipe, impersonate the `wssrvc.exe` client, and gain elevated privileges.
